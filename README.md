# Logistics-and-supply-chain-analysis-projects
- These are the two selected projects I have done in my previous internship.
- All the confidential company information has been anonymized, and the numbers have been adjusted.
- These two projects are just for showcasing my business analytics and report-writing skills, specifically using R and R Markdown. Please DO NOT replicate or disseminate the results.
- Both projects are bilingual and were translated by myself.
## First project -- Inbound costs per kg by supplier country&transportation
This project is meant to reduce the costs of logistics and to better calculate the KPI of the traders. As the name suggests, I extract critical financial payments and logistics information from a rich dataset and group the data using transportation and country.

## Second project -- How long do our clients pay?
This project is meant to inspect and improve the healthiness of cash flow. The company wanted to receive the payment from the clients within three days. Therefore, I try to find out what customers finish the payment longer than three working days and five working days after getting the invoices
